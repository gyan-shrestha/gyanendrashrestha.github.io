I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the Florida State University with a focus on web-scale data science, analytics, and machine learning. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. Michael Gubanov at Big Lab. Prior to joining in FSU, I obtained my bachelor degree from Institue of Engineering, Thapathali Camopus at Tribhuvan University and gained valable industry experience for nearly three years.
